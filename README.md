# Out-of-Bounds Vector Access in Rust

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: accessing an element in a `Vec` using an index that is out of bounds.  This results in a runtime panic.

The `bug.rs` file contains the faulty code. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version, demonstrating how to avoid this error.

This example highlights the importance of careful index handling in Rust when working with vectors and other collections.
